# org-snooze.el
Snooze your code, doc, feed in Emacs

## Installation

The package can be installed via MELPA. The package name is **org-snooze**.

## How to Use

Focus on the active file buffer, then use `M-x org-snooze`. It would asks you to set a snooze time.
Then Emacs would remind you at the given time through **appt reminder**.

Note that if you want some fancy functionality like system notification and sound alert. Please check my **appt** config at [here](https://github.com/xueeinstein/emacs.d/blob/98209180873fefc0172e24dd23165ab872faab93/lisp/init-org.el#L419).
